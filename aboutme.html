  <p><b>Name: </b>Adam Lieberman</p> 
  <p><b>Age: </b>22</p> 
  <p><b>Degrees: </b>Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics. Working on finishing my master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. Both from the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p> 
  <p><b>Experience: </b>I worked as a quant for Myron Scholes and his Asset Allocation team during my undergrad. I helped them create a tool for securities exposure within their portfolios, clean and explore data, researched copulas, and built a variety of other financial tools. I also worked as a quant at Lucena Research, where I wrote a trading strategy with a premise on optimization and machine learning. I co-founded a company called <a href='http://www.capp.io'>Cappio</a>, to help average investors make active trading decisions, which was acquired by Simply Wall St. I am currently working on a project that uses interactive visualizations to help average investors use machine learning and optimization to obtain higher returns and lower risk within their portfolios. Additionally, I have written many of my own strategies. These strategies have ranged from simple optimization rebalancings to twitter senitment analysis to mathematical function analysis to computational astrophysics.</p>
  <p><b>Programming : </b>Python, Matlab, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript & JQuery</p>
  <p><b>Interests: </b>I am primarily interested in quantitative finance. I also find healtcare data interesting. I used to play basketball but now I just watch  NBA, NCAA when I get free time. </p>
  <p><b>Useful courses I have taken: </b>Numerical Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis 1, Real Analysis 2, Complex Analysis, Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Differential Geometry, Machine Learning, Data Visualization & Analytics, Computer Vision, Big Data for Healthcare, Health Informatics, Web Search & Text Mining, Stellar Astrophysics, Machine Learning for Trading</p>
  <p><b>Resume: </b>You can find my resume <a href='https://ad1m.github.io/resume.pdf'>here</a></p>
  <p><b>Personal Website: </b>You can find my personal website <a href='https://ad1m.github.io/'>here</a></p>
  <p><b>Books: </b>I primarily read Technical books. I have been reading from Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop, The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerone H. Friedman, Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell, Flask Web Development by Miguel Grinberg.</p>
  <p><b>Freelance Development: </b>I sometimes take on personal freelance development projects. If you are interested please check my personal website and send me mail from there.</p>
  <p><b>Blog: </b>I started this blog because I am passionate about helping others understand finance, especially from a more quantitative view. I have had many friends and colleauges ask me to explain quantitative trading and this blog not only caters to them, but anyone interested in finance and or python. No prior experience with finance or python is needed. I plan to add more content to the blog covering different areas in mathematics and computer science. Thanks for taking the time to check out the blog!</p>
