              <p>Python is a a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. High-level smeans that python has a strong abstraction from details of the computer: it uses more natural langauge elements (written more like english) and is easy to write and read. General-purpose means we can use python to write a variety of software in many different application domains. Interpreted means that python directly performs instructions in the code without previously compiling them into a machine language program. Dynamic means that python, at runtime (when we run the program), executes many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation. For example, the program might need to be extended (adding new code) to objects and definitions or the type system might need to be modified. 
              </p>

              <p>
              With python we can choose a wide variety of programming paradigms. We can write imperative, functional, object-oriented, and procedural style code. Additionally, python has automatic memory management and an impressive standard library. We can use python on a variety of operating systems such as Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux.
              </p>

              <p>
              Python is used heavily in the financial industry: hedge funds, asset management firms, private wealth management firms, and other large financial institutions use python for quantitative analysis, web applications, and other software developement. Python is also used in many quantitative or computational finance college courses. It is a great language for translating quantitative theory into executable code.
              </p>

              <p>Let's get python installed on your machine so that we can setup our quant environment. To first check if you have python go to your terminal and type in python --version as shown in the image below (note that this is for Mac OSX, please use the syntax required for your operating system):</p>


              <center><div class='shorter' style='background:white'>
              <p style='text-align:left'>[USER-MacBook-Pro:~ username$ python --version</p>
              <p style='text-align:left'>Python 2.7.9</p>
              </div></center>
              <!--<center><img src='python_setup/checkpy.png' width='450px'></center> -->

              <p>If you have python, you will see Python followed by a version number after you have installed Python. We will want Python version 2.7.9. If your version number is not python 2.7.9. please continue and follow the installation instructions.</p>

              <p>Download python version 2.7.9 from <a  href='https://www.python.org/downloads/'>here</a>. Select your operating system and version 2.7.9 and follow the instructions. Make sure that you set python 2.7.9 as your main version of python if you have an alternate version installed (so if you use the terminal to run the python program you use version 2.7.9). Alteratively, you can setup a virtual environment if you wish and run python 2.7 from it. If you wish to setup a virtual environment, check out the link <a href='http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/'>here</a>.</p>

              <p>
              Next, we will download anaconda. This contains over 100 of the most popular python packages for data science. Download the graphical installer for python version 2.7 <a href='https://www.continuum.io/downloads'>here</a> and follow the instructions (you can also use the command-line installer if you are familiar with the command line).
              </p>

              <p>Finally, it is nice to use an Integrated Developement Environment (IDE). This is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to software developers. Within the IDE there is a code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. The IDE also has code completion. PyCharm is a great IDE and can be downloaded <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/'>here</a>. For further download instructions and a quick overview of PyCharm usage check out the video series the creator, JetBrains, has made <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rSBPGGLkW0'>here</a>.
              </p> 

              <p>If there are any installation troubles please check out the video <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-B2sybfX80'>here</a> or email me for further assistance.</a>

              <p>We now have the basis of our quant developement environment setup.</p>

              <!--<p class="preview__excerpt" itemprop="description">Getting access to historical financial data is expensive. Let's set up an environment that will help us scrape financial data from yahoo finance.</p>
              <p>The first tool we will need is Python 2.7.9. Python version 2.7.9 is a programming langauge that is fast, easy to learn, and has tons of modules readily available. Download python version 2.7.9 from <a  href='https://www.python.org/downloads/'>here</a>. Select your correct operating system, click download, and follow the insturctions.</p> If you're not familiar with python syntax check out the python primer <a href='Python_Primer.html'>here</a> or some introduction videos <a href='https://pythonprogramming.net/python-fundamental-tutorials/'>here</a> before you proceed.
              <p> Then, head over <a href='https://www.continuum.io/downloads'>here</a> and download the graphical installer for anaconda for python 2.7. Anaconda is a distibution that contains a bunch of python libraries that we will need.</p>
              <p>Next, download an IDE to run your python programs. PyCharm is a great IDE and can be downloaded <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/'>here</a>. -->
